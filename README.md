This script analyzes Cassandra query performance from Pega log files. It parses each log line to extract the query string and its execution time, converting all timings to milliseconds for consistency. Using Polars, it groups identical queries and calculates key statistics: average execution time and 50th, 75th, 95th, and 99th percentiles. The results are visualized in a Plotly bar chart for the top slowest queries, helping you quickly spot performance bottlenecks. This approach enables efficient, data-driven troubleshooting and optimization of Cassandra usage in Pega applications.
